# Fabric Application

Welcome to the Fabric Application, the base implementation of the Fabric Framework. This repository provides a starting point for developing web applications using the Fabric Framework, similar to how Laravel provides a base application for its Illuminate components.

## Overview

The Fabric Application is designed to offer a familiar structure and environment for developers transitioning from Laravel to Dart. It includes all the necessary components and configurations to kickstart your web development projects using the Fabric Framework.

## Goals

1. **Provide a Ready-to-Use Application:** Offer a base application setup that allows developers to start building immediately.
2. **Ensure Compatibility with Fabric Framework:** Seamlessly integrate with the Fabric Framework and its modular components.
3. **Facilitate Rapid Development:** Enable quick setup and deployment of web applications using Dart.

## Key Features

- **Pre-configured Structure:** A well-organized directory structure inspired by Laravel.
- **Integrated Components:** Includes essential components from the Fabric Framework for immediate use.
- **Environment Configuration:** Simple and flexible environment configuration system.
- **Pre-built Scripts:** Useful scripts for common tasks like migrations, testing, and serving the application.
